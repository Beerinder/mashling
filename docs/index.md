# Getting Started With Project Mashling<sup>TM</sup>


### Getting started with the UI 

Project Mashling comes with a collection of curated recipes for common microgateway patterns searchable on http://mashling.io

To get started : 

1. Find a recipe that is of interest to you

2. Browse the details on the recipe

3. Use the "Try it now" button to download the corresponding pre-created Mashling application

4. Each recipe comes with detailed usage instruction. A recipe README file, as an example [here](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling-recipes/blob/master/recipes/event-dispatcher-router-mashling/README.md) 

5. You can also customize each recipe and download the corresponding recipe file directly


### Getting started with CLI
